# Boids Assemble! #

![](images/50k_default.gif)

## Introduction

Boids are a computer simulation of an animal(eg. fish/bird) that flies in flocks or swarms.
In this assignment I have implemented a flocking simulation based on the Reynolds Boids algorithm, optimized using a uniform grid. Another level of optimization to be implemented is using a uniform grid with semi-coherent memory access.
